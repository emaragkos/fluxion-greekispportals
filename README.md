A few Fluxion Captive Portals themed after Greek ISPs

The Captive Portal attack attempts to retrieve the target access pointâ€™s WPA/WPA2 key by means of a rogue network with a border authentication captive portal. It is recommended this attack is done in close, to semi-close, proximity to the target access point. This is due to the fact the attack host (your machine) will be serving the captive portal, meaning, clients will need to have a decent Wi-Fi connection to your machine.

These portals work with the famous Fluxion

Fluxion is a security auditing and social-engineering research tool.
